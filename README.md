a wifi controlled door 

fun project made for a presentation at MOF (those who know know)

You can control your door handle , ie open the door , with you phone or computer which is connected to the wifi network of your house.\

- No need to carry keys when you pop out
- No need to get up from the coach when your friends knock the door ;-)
- Make an impression to your spouse

Improve in anyway you like!
